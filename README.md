# Copy Worksheet
Copy Worksheet is a tool for automating the process of conditionally copying rows and columns from one or more source worksheet to a single target worksheet.

Copy Worksheet allows the users to define multiple sets of rules that are saved and later executed against a set of source worksheets to a target worksheet. The rules can be as simple as copy column A from source Sheet 1 to column B in target Sheet 2 or complex in having conditional statement for both source sheet and target sheet, e.g. copy column A from source Sheet 1 if column D in source Sheet 1 is greater than 1000 paste to column B target Sheet 2 where column E equals column C in source Sheet 1.
